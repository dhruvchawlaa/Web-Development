# Web Development
This collection compiles all the materials, notes, and programs I generated during my enrollment in Angela Yu's "Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. I supplemented my learning with additional resources, amalgamating all my knowledge within this repository.

This repository delves into both front-end and back-end web development. It houses my personal code, notes, and the ones provided by the courses I've taken along the way. Furthermore, it encompasses inquiries and challenges that have fortified my grasp of these concepts.
